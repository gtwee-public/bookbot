# bookbot
Author: Gunnar Tweeton

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!
This project was started on 10/24/25 and completed on 10/28/25.

This program will take in an additional argument at runtime that 
will define where the file location to be analyzed is located.
(python3 main.py <file location>)

This program will print out to the terminal a total word count, as
well as a neatly organized list of each instance of individual 
characters sorted in descending order from highest to lowest 
occurances.
